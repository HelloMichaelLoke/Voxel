# Voxel

This is a repository for a Voxel Game in Unity.

It includes Multi-Threaded Marching Cubes Terrain with Flood Fill Lighting and Height Map Based Texture Blending and Biome Generation.
It does not include Chunk Editing yet and is therefore very early Alpha.
I do not work on this project currently so anybody is welcome to join development.

The project also contains some random scripts that I used for experimentation. It probably needs some clean up if you want to use it in your project.
